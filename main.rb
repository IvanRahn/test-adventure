and enjoying your childhood. The sun is just starting to rise in the East over the majestic Mystical Mountains covered by fog.
To the west you can see the slight outline of the treetops in the Funky Forest. Now with your new pokemon friend
you feel like everything is possible! Which way do you choose to go?"
